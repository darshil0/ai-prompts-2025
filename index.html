Text: "Handle Multimodal Inputs Coherently" (dark charcoal, sans-serif, medium weight).
"Prioritize Critical Instructions":Icon: A stylized funnel image, narrowing downwards. The top of the funnel should be labeled "System Instructions" and the narrow bottom "Constraints". Use a soft teal (#A7E8E0) for the funnel.
Text: "Prioritize Critical Instructions" (dark charcoal, sans-serif, medium weight).
"Structure for Long Contexts":Icon: Three layered, slightly transparent rectangular blocks. The bottom, largest block labeled "Large Context First", and the top, smallest block labeled "Specific Instructions Last". Use a soft purple (#D4BCF7) for the blocks.
Text: "Structure for Long Contexts" (dark charcoal, sans-serif, medium weight).
"Anchor Context":Icon: A stylized bridge connecting two elements: a rectangular block labeled "Data" on one side, and a thought/query bubble on the other. Use light gray (#E0E0E0) with blue accents for the bridge.
Text: "Anchor Context" (dark charcoal, sans-serif, medium weight).
Visual Constraints & Refinements
All text must be legible, perfectly aligned, and consistently styled (sans-serif, dark charcoal).
Icons should be visually balanced with their corresponding text, not too large or too small.
Spacing: Ensure generous, consistent padding around all elements, inside panels, and between the main banner, label, and columns.
The overall impression should be one of simplicity, professionalism, and ease of understanding.`

Subject
Appearance:
He is depicted in his iconic full pirate attire: a distressed, dark teal/blue long coat with ornate gold buttons and faded trim, a dirty white ruffled shirt, a vibrant red bandana tied around his head, and a large, weathered tricorn hat adorned with a feather, trinkets, and tattered edges.
His hair is a mass of intricate dreadlocks, adorned with beads, coins, and fabric scraps, visible beneath and around his hat.
He has his signature goatee and mustache, with a smirk/slight grin on his face, and his eyes show a mischievous, confident glint.
Pose:
He stands confidently, slightly turned towards the viewer, with his right hand (viewer's left) resting on the hilt of his ornate cutlass, which is pointed downwards.
His left hand (viewer's right) is slightly extended forward, palm open, as if in a characteristic gesture.
His posture is relaxed but commanding.
Accessories:
Detailed leather cross-body strap holding a pistol (a flintlock, visible on his hip), various rings on his fingers, multiple layered belts and sashes around his waist with pouches and compass.
Setting
Location:
On the weathered, wooden deck of a large sailing pirate ship. The wooden planks are detailed with grain and subtle wear.
Background:
The open ocean at sunset. The sun is a prominent, warm orange/yellow sphere on the horizon, casting a dramatic, warm glow across the sky and water.
There are dynamic, white-capped waves in the mid-ground.
The ship's rigging and masts are visible, silhouetted against the vibrant sky, adding depth and scale.
Lighting & Mood
Lighting:
Dramatic golden hour lighting from the sunset, casting warm, rich tones on Jack Sparrow and the ship.
Strong backlighting from the sun creates a rim light effect, particularly on his hat and hair, while his front is well-lit by the ambient golden light.
Mood:
Adventurous, legendary, iconic, and slightly theatrical.
Composition & Perspective
Shot Type:
A medium full shot, capturing Jack Sparrow from just above the knees up, centered in the frame.
Angle:
Eye-level or a very slightly low-angle perspective, making him appear heroic.
Depth of Field:
A moderate depth of field, keeping Jack Sparrow sharply in focus, with the background ship elements and ocean slightly blurred to emphasize him.
Technical Quality & Details
Resolution: Ultra 8K resolution.
Texture: Exquisite detail on all textures: weathered leather, fabric of his coat and bandana, individual dreadlocks, skin pores and wrinkles, wood grain of the deck, and intricate metalwork on his pistol and cutlass.
Color Grading: Rich, cinematic color grading with warm oranges, yellows, deep blues, and muted greens.
Atmosphere: A subtle haze or glow around the setting sun.`

                content: `Subject & Concept
A high-resolution, photorealistic image of a sleek, ergonomic computer mouse. The mouse is a dark charcoal gray or gunmetal color with a smooth, matte finish. It features a bright cyan blue LED glowing from the scroll wheel and subtle chrome accents on the sides.

Presentation & Composition
The mouse is presented on a small, torn piece of off-white sketch paper, which includes faint, clean technical lines and handwritten text reading "RECHARGEABLE USB-C" near the bottom. This sketch appears to be floating or held by a clear acrylic stand anchored to a circular, dark mahogany wood base.

Environment & Lighting
The scene is an executive office desk setup during the late afternoon. The background should feature a large window overlooking a bright, slightly hazy cityscape, creating a soft backlight. The foreground lighting should be cinematic and dramatic, with subtle reflections and highlights on the mouse's surface to emphasize its contours.

Style & Technical Details
Extreme hyperrealism, product photography style. Shallow depth of field (bokeh) to isolate the mouse and base. 8K resolution. Rendered in the style of V-Ray or Octane Render. The image must have physically based rendering (PBR) accuracy, showing realistic textures, light falloff, and subtle dust/micro-scratches on the wood/acrylic for maximum realism.`

                content: `9.1 Packaging Transformation
Transform the image into a 90s style Indian toffee packaging design inspired by <favourite candy>. The packaging should be vivid and colorful, featuring vibrant oranges, yellows, and reds. Include nostalgic fonts and typography inspired by India's 90s advertising, with bold and playful lettering. The overall look should evoke nostalgia with bright and lively colors, capturing the vintage essence of Indian candy wrappers.

9.2 Retro Bollywood
A hyper-realistic photograph with the warm, grainy tones and retro cinematic vibe of a 1970s film camera.

Subject
A stylish female as in the reference image sitting casually on the hood of a vintage classic car. She is wearing a white & red polka dot pinstriped shirt, with bell-bottom trousers, paired with canvas shoes, exuding a confident, 1970s Bollywood diva-style look. Preserve the face, facial structures, expressions, and body proportions from the provided reference image (the subject is smiling with glasses, looking directly at the camera). The subject's pose must be maintained—sitting on the car's hood, in a casual, candid manner.

Car
A large, classic American luxury car (no visible logos) in a deep maroon or royal color. It features wide whitewall tires, prominent chrome details on the grille and bumpers, and a highly polished metallic body that reflects sunlight.

Setting
Outdoors in daylight. The background is framed by tall green trees and well-maintained hedges. The scene should be well-lit, suggesting a sunny day.

Style & Atmosphere
Vintage 1970s Bollywood film aesthetic, high-quality, hyper-realistic photography.

9.3 Classroom Portrait
Cinematic portrait of the man in the picture (preserve 100% facial details of this man), vintage classroom. The camera is shot from a distance, with a small section of the chair's back visible in front, as if the photographer was taking the portrait discreetly or in a quiet moment. Soft, golden-yellow lighting reflects from a small window or gap in the right wall, forming diagonal lines of light that fall directly on the man's face, creating a dramatic and emotional contrast. The man sits alone in a chair, his feet resting on the desk, with a relaxed and cool expression, as if lost in thought.

9.4 Re-light
Relight this photo of me in moody club lighting using soft pink, purple, and blue neon tones coming from opposite sides. Keep the lighting directional but diffused, with reflections on the face and hair, subtle color contrast, and a blurred dark background that hints at glowing lights. Preserve facial details and makeup.

9.5 Royalty
Recreate this couple photo in the grand, opulent style of a Bollywood film. We are dressed as Indian royalty, wearing a heavy, intricately embroidered lehenga and sherwani in jewel tones like deep blue, green, orange and gold. We are posing in a magnificent palace corridor, with grand arches, fresco paintings, and numerous lit diyas in the background. The lighting is dramatic and warm, with a soft, hazy glow. My expression is regal, intense, and full of unspoken emotion. Before you do anything else, ask me to upload a selfie. Then use that selfie to create this image. Keep our faces the same and show the grandeur of the palace corridor too. Aspect ratio should be 1:1.

9.6 Underwater Portrait
Hyper-realistic, ultra-detailed close-up portrait showing only the left half of my face submerged in water, one eye in sharp focus, positioned on the far left of the frame, light rays creating caustic patterns on the skin, suspended water droplets and bubbles adding depth, cinematic lighting with soft shadows and sharp highlights, photorealistic textures including skin pores, wet lips, eyelashes, and subtle subsurface scattering, surreal and dreamlike atmosphere, shallow depth of field, underwater macro perspective. 1:1 aspect ratio.`
